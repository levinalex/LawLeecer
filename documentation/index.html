<h1>Law Leecher</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
Law Leecher is a multi-threaded web crawling tool which extracts laws from the EU law database PreLex (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/">http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/</a>). It's written in Ruby.<br>
The latest version is 1.3.1<br>
You can also visit the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lawleecher/">SourceForge project management homepage</a>. You will most probably find the version history there (what's new, fixed bugs) for new versions.

<h2>SVN checkout</h2>
You can checkout the repository by issuing a 
<code>
svn co https://lawleecher.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lawleecher lawleecher
</code>.
You don't need to compile something, however you have to install Ruby and (if you want to have the GUI) GTK+. Read the few lines of the manual for this.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
The documentation is done with LaTeX. You can read the latest <a href="http://lawleecher.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lawleecher/trunk/documentation/tex/Documentation.pdf?view=log">PDF in the SVN repository</a> (download the PDF of the latest (= highest) revision).<br>
The documentation comprises installation instructions, a user manual, and a developer's guide.

<h2>Localization</h2>
Law Leecher is not internationalized. Therefore it cannot be localized. However, its output is written in a specific language which is English for command line output and German for GUI.
